I'm a second-year undergraduate student from Hong Kong, studying at Fudan University. During my studies at Fudan University, I gained valuable research experience as an intern at the Fudan Natural Language Processing Lab, where I had the privilege of being mentored by Prof. Xipeng Qiu. My research interests include multimodal LLMs, reinforcement learning and LLM-based Agent.

I am happy to discuss potential collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out!
