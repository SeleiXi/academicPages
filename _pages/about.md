I'm a year 2 undergraduate student from Hong Kong, studying at Fudan University. During my studies at Fudan University, I gained valuable research experience as an intern at the Fudan Natural Language Processing Lab, where I had the privilege of being mentored by Prof. Xipeng Qiu. My research interests include reinforcement learning and multimodal agent.

# Scholarship
[__Hong Kong Young Technology and Innovation Talent（香港青年科創英才）__](https://www.swire.com/en/community/hkytit.php) 

__<ins>The scholarship is only awarded to 100 students each year.</ins>__

The Swire Group launched the “Hong Kong Young Technology and Innovation Talent” (“HKYTIT”) programme in 2023. This initiative is designed to support sci-tech innovation and foster people-to-people exchange between the Chinese Mainland and the Hong Kong SAR. The programme is supported by the Office of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Affairs of the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China, the Beijing Office of the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government in the Hong Kong SAR, the Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Affairs Office of the China Association for Science and Technology, and the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Government of Hong Kong SAR of the People’s Republic of China. In 2024, the Hong Kong Subsidized Secondary Schools Council, Hong Kong Direct Subsidy Scheme Schools Council and the Hong Kong Association for Computer Education also joined the programme as co-organisers. HKYTIT aims to provide opportunities for Hong Kong students who have achieved excellent academic results, aspire to engage in sci-tech innovation, and are of good moral character, to study majors related to science and technology at Chinese Mainland universities.

__[Award notice](https://www.stuaff.fudan.edu.cn/6e/1f/c10227a749087/page.htm) <ins> (Be awarded as the only student from College of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence)</ins>__

Each year, 500 students are selected from over 120 universities nationwide (including about 60 students from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau), with Fudan University allocated only 6 spots in total (2 of which are for students from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau). This fund is one of the most prestigious and nationally recognized educational awards in the country, established with capital from State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), supported and guided by the government, advised and planned by experts, and actively participated in by universities.
<!-- 每年从全国120余所高校中选举500名学生（其中台港澳地区60名左右），其中复旦全校只有6个名额（台港澳地区共2个）；该项基金是国有企业出资设立，政府支持指导，专家咨询策划，高校积极参与的全国最具知名度的教育奖项之一。 -->



# Project Experience
__Danta Treehole__  
Since 2025, I've led the backend department of the Danta Team, the largest Computer Science and development team at Fudan University. Our team develops an internal forum for Fudan students, which boasts an average of 6,000 active students and over 110,000 posts monthly. Beyond leading the backend department, I've also engaged in server maintenance, HR management and AI agent design for the team.
